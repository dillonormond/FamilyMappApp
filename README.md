# FamilyMappApp

This is an android application that I deveoped, both front-end and back-end in Java.
The application takes user info to create an account stores it in the backend, and authenticates when the user attempts to login.
When the user signs up, a random, procedurally generated family tree is made for them. The events of their family members (birth, marriage, death, etc.) 
are shown on the map (using Google maps API) and are connected with lines to show relationships. There are various settings to change what the user wants 
to see/filter on the map.
